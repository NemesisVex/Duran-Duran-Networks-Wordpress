# Duran Duran Networks Wordpress

Duran Duran Networks Wordpress is the Wordpress installation that powers the Duran Duran Networks blog.

## History

Duran Duran Networks was an experiment with consuming REST APIs from various web sites to aggregate information about Duran Duran.

The project is on permanant hiatus.

## About this repository

The repository contains the full installation of Wordpress alongside third-party plugins and my own customizations (themes, plugins, etc.).

Content of the uploads directory is excluded, as well as the ``wp-config.php`` file.

Updates to Wordpress are pulled from the Wordpress Github repo and pushed here. Plugin updates are also reflected in this repo.
